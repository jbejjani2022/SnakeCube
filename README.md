# SnakeCube
[SnakeCube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_J05hN6BZY) is a reimagination of the classic Snake computer game from a two-dimensional screen to a three-dimensional self-contained LED cube. Using a gyroscope and Arduino microcontroller, SnakeCube reads the userâ€™s rotational input and transforms it into an interactive game on the faces of the cube. This repository contains our code for the game, including processing of gyroscope data from the cube, game-cube control and logic, and a suite of tests.

Encased in lasercut transparent acrylic, the cube's electronic components include NeoPixel LED strips, an Arduino MKRZERO, a BNO08x gyroscope, a few SN74AHCT125N logic level shifters, and a few staple components such as a piezo buzzer, potentiometer, protoboard, breadboard, slide switch, battery pack, and many wires and buttons.

A lot of design work went into coordinating the movement of the snake across different faces, as well as creating a self-contained, closed game environment robust to quick rotations on all axes. Team: Joey Bejjani, Aiman Anuar, Dillon Browning, Grayson Martin.
